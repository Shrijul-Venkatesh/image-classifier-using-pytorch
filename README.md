# Digit Recognition and Image Classifier

A deep learning project for recognising digits in an image, written in python

## Features

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- Model training is performed on the MNIST database of handwritten digits
- Uses matplotlib to represent the image during testing for easier user interaction and analysis.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

Uncomment the

```python
print(train_data.data.shape())
print(train_data.data.shape())
```

code provided in the main.py file and execute it using the following command :

```bash
python main.py

```

This should first download the MNIST dataset into a folder called data. You should also get 60000 and 10000 as the shapes of the training and testing datasets respectively.

## Dataset

This project uses the TensorFlow [MNIST dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) of handwritten images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
